For those who complained, I&#x27;m sorry if this post comes across as complainy or redundant, I respect the HN hive-mind and was genuinely curious about everyone&#x27;s thoughts on the matter.<p>Hello fellow travelers, I&#x27;ll do my best to keep this brief(ish).<p>I&#x27;ve been in IT professionally since Y2K, data entry-&gt;QA-&gt;SysAdmin-&gt;PM-&gt;consultant-&gt;founder-&gt;sold and with the money took some years off, bought some property and a fixer upper and went to school and got a BSBA degree (never graduated from high school but wanted to show my kids the importance of a degree).    I missed working and creating things with people so decided to reenter the job market in the PM space.  So now that my hat is in the ring I have been told by recruiters what I need to &quot;expect&quot; in this &quot;new market.&quot;<p>I was told &quot;5 to 7 interviews is normal&quot;.  What?  I genuinely feel like I&#x27;m having a &#x27;Blast from the Past&#x27; moment in this whole thing (good 90s romcom kids, look it up).<p>When did a hiring manager lose their authority and the trust of the organization to do their job?  Am I just out of touch?  How is a process like this in any way shape or form efficient or productive? Am i missing something?  HN, please help!",
